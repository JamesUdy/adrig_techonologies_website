              design and features are aligned with the exact market needs.
              Whether you are proving a business case or testing if a new idea
              works, a rapid prototype can help you understand what works and
              what does not. Rapid prototype built by our team of IoT hardware

              Edge computing is implemented on IoT devices rather than the
              conventional cloud computing approach. This ensures lower latency
              and faster data offloading times, while also enabling the
              management of more access points. By leveraging edge computing,
              organizations can save on data storage requirements by processing
              data in real-time, rather than collecting all the data in the
              cloud and then analyzing it.
