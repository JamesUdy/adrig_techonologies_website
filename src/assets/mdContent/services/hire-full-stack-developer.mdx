  # Our Development Process for Fixed-Bid and Dedicated Team Model We employ an
  agile approach to accelerate the software deployment process. Through the
  agile methodology, we conduct daily scrum meetings to plan and monitor the
  project's advancement. Our team regularly holds sprint retrospective sessions
  where we, along with the project stakeholder, review the recently completed
  sprint and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, we practice
  continuous integration to promptly detect and address any issues. After
  conducting thorough and ongoing testing, we make certain to evaluate the
  software at each stage of the continuous delivery workflow. We build the
  tailored digital solution within the scheduled timeframe and minimize the time
  required to bring the product to market by embracing agile development
  methodologies.
