  Our Cosmos development experts can create resilient, interconnected
  application-specific blockchains, decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges,
  digital wallets, and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. They utilize the
  Cosmos SDK Ignite CLI and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol in
  their work. Proficient in the programming languages Golang and Rust, they can
  effortlessly build high-level applications, decentralized exchanges, and smart
  contracts that take advantage of Cosmos' vertical and horizontal scalability
  features.
